# Code for "Assortative and Preferential Attachment lead to core-periphery networks
This repository contains the code used for the article "Assortative and Preferential Attachent leads to core-periphery networks" by Urena-Carrion, Karimi, Iniguez and Kivel√§. 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

In our project we show how the combination of two common evolution mechansisms can lead to core-periphery in networks using a growing and a rewiring model. Folder `phase_space` contains code for reproducing our phase space analysis, while `data_fit` the code for processing datasets and using maximum-likelihood methods for fitting datasets. Each of these folders contains a `README` file with instructions. File `simulation_model.py` contains the script for simulating both growing and rewiring models. 

### Prerequisites

Our implementations use common Python distributions: `numpy`, `networkx`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `itertools`.
